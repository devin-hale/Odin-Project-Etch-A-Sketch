# Etch-A-Sketch
 
Project File for Odin Project Etch A Sketch

v 0.1 - 2-14-2023
Trying to dust off CSS and HTML skills, understand JS DOM manipulation better.
Lot's of googling, but the basic functionality works, minus the rainbow selector.
The plain is to actually make this usable, add more colors, etc.
Basically a psuedo MS paint.

v 0.2 - 2-15-2023
Made everything work as described by the Odin Project guidelines + extra.  May come back later
and make it look pretty but I'm pretty satisfied with how it works right now.
